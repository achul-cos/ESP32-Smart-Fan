## 📖 Project Overview
The ESP32-Smart-Fan project is a smart fan controller that leverages the ESP32 microcontroller. This system uses a DHT22 sensor to check temperature and humidity levels in your space. By connecting to the Blynk IoT platform, you can monitor and control your fan from anywhere using your smartphone. 

The system offers two modes of operation:
- **Automatic Mode**: The fan operates based on predefined temperature and humidity thresholds.
- **Manual Mode**: You can override the automatic settings whenever you choose.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Remote Control**: Manage your fan through the Blynk app.
- **Temperature & Humidity Monitoring**: Keep track of ambient conditions.
- **Customizable Settings**: Set your own thresholds for fan operation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy setup with the Blynk IoT platform.
- **Automatic and Manual Modes**: Choose how you want your fan to run.

## 📦 System Requirements
- **Hardware**: ESP32 development board, DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor, relay module.
- **Software**: Blynk app (available on iOS and Android).
- **Network**: Wi-Fi connection to link the ESP32 and your smartphone.
